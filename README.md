# QT_BT_app_HM10
It is copy of my project on which I was working in science club KN FENEC of AGH. It is bluetooth app to communicate with our AUV project using bluetooth transmitter built from HM10 Bluetooth module and LORA Radio module supporting AT commands.

Most of courses for QT BT app are for BT 2.0 module and it was very time-consuming to make communication work with BT LE. This project is a skeleton with working BT communication (sending/receiving data and logging in the app) without our AUV logics. Feel free to use it

# Images_on_osciloscope
It is code in jupyter notebook (python) to convert image (black with white trail) to generate X and Y signals array to generate this image on osciloscope using 2 dac channels of our microcontroller and xy mode in osciloscope.
